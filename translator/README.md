## Running unit tests for customization
* Clone the repository, then make the desired code changes
* Next, run unit tests to make sure added customization passes the tests
```
cd ./deployment
chmod +x ./run-unit-tests.sh  \n
./run-unit-tests.sh \n
```

## Building distributable for customization
* Configure the bucket name of your target Amazon S3 distribution bucket
```
export DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET=my-bucket-name # bucket where customized code will reside
export SOLUTION_NAME=my-solution-name
export VERSION=my-version # version number for the customized code
```
_Note:_ You would have to create an S3 bucket with the prefix 'my-bucket-name-<aws_region>'; aws_region is where you are testing the customized solution. Also, the assets in bucket should be publicly accessible.

* Now build the distributable:
```
chmod +x ./build-s3-dist.sh \n
./build-s3-dist.sh $DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET $SOLUTION_NAME $VERSION \n
```

* Deploy the distributable to an Amazon S3 bucket in your account. _Note:_ you must have the AWS Command Line Interface installed.
```
aws s3 cp ./dist/ s3://my-bucket-name-<aws_region>/$SOLUTION_NAME/$VERSION/ --recursive --acl bucket-owner-full-control --profile aws-cred-profile-name \n
```

* Get the link of the solution template uploaded to your Amazon S3 bucket.
* Deploy the solution to your account by launching a new AWS CloudFormation stack using the link of the solution template in Amazon S3.
